# About 

This code takes in the price of the item and the tax percentage as inputs from the user using the Scanner class. It then calculates the tax amount by multiplying the price by the tax percentage and adds it to the price to get the total amount. The code then prints out the price, tax and total amount for the customer.

You can further expand this code to include more functionality such as adding more items to the purchase, calculating the total cost of all items, handling discount, and printing a receipt. You can also add a user interface for the customer to interact with the system instead of using command line input.
